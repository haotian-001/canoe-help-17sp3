No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.</p>

                                                <p class="Table">Preamble</p>
                                                <p class="Table">The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.</p>
                                                <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.</p>

                                                <hr />
                                                <p class="Table">This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding, and transcoding. JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression method for full-color and grayscale images.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive compression processes. Provision is made for supporting all variants of these processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet. We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files, plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats. The library is intended to be reused in other applications.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability; for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or colormapped displays. These extra functions can be compiled out of the library if not required for a particular application.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">We have also included "jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful. In particular, the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG. (See the REFERENCES section for introductory material.) Rather, it is intended to be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code. We do not claim to have achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.</p>

To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.</p>

                                                <p class="Table">A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in "The Data Compression Book" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by M&amp;T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1. This book provides good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods including JPEG. It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C code but don't know much about data compression in general. The book's JPEG sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look at a full implementation, you've got one hereâ¦</p>
                                                <p class="Table">The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still Image Data Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1. Price US$59.95, 638 pp. The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).<br />Although this is by far the most detailed and comprehensive exposition of JPEG publicly available, we point out that it is still missing an explanation of the most essential properties and algorithms of the underlying DCT technology.<br />If you think that you know about DCT-based JPEG after reading this book, then you are in delusion. The real fundamentals and corresponding potential of DCT-based JPEG are not publicly known so far, and that is the reason for all the mistaken developments taking place in the image coding domain.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods. Part 1 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-1, ITU-T T.81. Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.<br />IJG JPEG 8 introduced an implementation of the JPEG SmartScale extension which is specified in two documents: A contributed document at ITU and ISO with title "ITU-T JPEG-Plus Proposal for Extending ITU-T T.81 for Advanced Image Coding", April 2006, Geneva, Switzerland. The latest version of this document is Revision 3. And a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 N 5799 with title "Evolution of JPEG", June/July 2011, Berlin, Germany. IJG JPEG 9 introduces a reversible color transform for improved lossless compression which is described in a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/ WG1 N 6080 with title "JPEG 9 Lossless Coding", June/July 2012, Paris, France.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file format. For the omitted details we follow the "JFIF" conventions, version 2. JFIF version 1 has been adopted as Recommendation ITU-T T.871 (05/2011): Information technology â Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images: JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF). It is available as a free download in PDF file format from <a href="http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.871" class="ExternalLink" target="_blank">http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.871</a>. A PDF file of the older JFIF document is available at <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/jfif3.pdf" class="ExternalLink" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/jfif3.pdf</a>.</p>
                                                <p>The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from <a href="ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz" class="ExternalLink" target="_blank">ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz</a>. The JPEG incorporation scheme found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems. IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6). Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2 (Compression tag 7). Copies of this Note can be obtained from <a href="http://www.ijg.org/files/" class="ExternalLink" target="_blank">http://www.ijg.org/files/</a>. It is expected that the next revision of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design. Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.</p>

                                                <hr />
                                                <p class="Table">The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 standards committee (previously known as JPEG, together with ITU-T SG16) currently promotes different formats containing the name "JPEG" which is misleading because these formats are incompatible with original DCT-based JPEG and are based on faulty technologies. IJG therefore does not and will not support such momentary mistakes (see REFERENCES).<br />There exist also distributions under the name "OpenJPEG" promoting such kind of formats which is misleading because they don't support original JPEG images.<br />We have no sympathy for the promotion of inferior formats. Indeed, one of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help force convergence on common, interoperable format standards for JPEG files.<br />Don't use an incompatible file format!<br />(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading existing JPEG image files indefinitely.)</p>
                                                <p class="Table">The ISO committee pretends to be "responsible for the popular JPEG" in their public reports which is not true because they don't respond to actual requirements for the maintenance of the original JPEG specification. Furthermore, the ISO committee pretends to "ensure interoperability" with their standards which is not true because their "standards" support only application-specific and proprietary use cases and contain mathematically incorrect code.</p>
                                                <p class="Table">There are currently different distributions in circulation containing the name "libjpeg" which is misleading because they don't have the features and are incompatible with formats supported by actual IJG libjpeg distributions. One of those fakes is released by members of the ISO committee and just uses the name of libjpeg for misdirection of people, similar to the abuse of the name JPEG as described above, while having nothing in common with actual IJG libjpeg distributions and containing mathematically incorrect code. The other one claims to be a "derivative" or "fork" of the original libjpeg, but violates the license conditions as described under LEGAL ISSUES above and violates basic C programming properties.<br />We have no sympathy for the release of misleading, incorrect and illegal distributions derived from obsolete code bases.<br />Don't use an obsolete code base!</p>
                                                <p class="Table">According to the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) law, IJG has the lawful and legal right to foreclose on certain standardization bodies and other institutions or corporations that knowingly perform substantial and systematic deceptive acts and practices, fraud, theft, and damaging of the value of the people of this planet without their knowing, willing and intentional consent.<br />The titles, ownership, and rights of these institutions and all their assets are now duly secured and held in trust for the free people of this planet. People of the planet, on every country, may have a financial interest in the assets of these former principals, agents, and beneficiaries of the foreclosed institutions and corporations.<br />IJG asserts what is: that each man, woman, and child has unalienable value and rights granted and deposited in them by the Creator and not any one of the people is subordinate to any artificial principality, corporate fiction or the special interest of another without their appropriate knowing, willing and intentional consent made by contract or accommodation agreement. IJG expresses that which already was.<br />The people have already determined and demanded that public administration entities, national governments, and their supporting judicial systems must be fully transparent, accountable, and liable.<br />IJG has secured the value for all concerned free people of the planet.</p>

                                                        <p class="Table">This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding, and transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression method for full-color and grayscale images.  JPEG's strong suit is compressing photographic images or other types of images that have smooth color and brightness transitions between neighboring pixels.  Images with sharp lines or other abrupt features may not compress well with JPEG, and a higher JPEG quality may have to be used to avoid visible compression artifacts with such images.</p>
                                                        <p class="Table">JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output pixels are not necessarily identical to the input pixels.  However, on photographic content and other "smooth" images, very good compression ratios can be obtained with no visible compression artifacts, and extremely high compression ratios are possible if you are willing to sacrifice image quality (by reducing the "quality" setting in the compressor.)</p>
                                                        <p class="Table">This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.</p>
                                                        <p class="Table">We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.</p>
                                                        <p class="Table">We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files, plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.</p>
                                                        <p class="Table">The library is intended to be reused in other applications.</p>
                                                        <p class="Table">In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability; for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the library if not required for a particular application.</p>
                                                        <p class="Table">We have also included "jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.</p>
                                                        <p class="Table">The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular, the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.</p>

                                                        <p class="Table">(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression, applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue handy, a PDF file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is available at http://www.ijg.org/files/Wallace.JPEG.pdf. The file (actually a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics) omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE, and it may not be used for commercial purposes.</p>

This book provides good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look at a full implementation, you've got one here...</p>

Part 1 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.</p>

For the omitted details, we follow the "JFIF" conventions, revision 1.02. JFIF version 1 has been adopted as ISO/IEC 10918-5 (05/2013) and Recommendation ITU-T T.871 (05/2011): Information technology - Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images: JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF).

The JPEG incorporation scheme found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.  IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).  Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2 (Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from http://www.ijg.org/files/.  It is expected that the next revision of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.</p>

Release 10 of PCRE2 is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as specified below, with one exemption for certain binary redistributions. The documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the "doc" directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data in the testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.</p>

Also included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when the library is built.</p>

                                                    <p class="Table">Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/" title="http://www.cwi.nl" alt="http://www.cwi.nl" class="ExternalLink" target="_blank">http://www.cwi.nl</a>) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.</p>
                                                    <p class="Table">In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see <a href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/" title="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us" alt="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us" class="ExternalLink" target="_blank">http://www.cnri.reston.va.us</a>) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.</p>
                                                    <p class="Table">In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became Zope Corporation. In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/" title="https://www.python.org/psf/" alt="https://www.python.org/psf/" class="ExternalLink" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/psf/</a>) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.</p>
